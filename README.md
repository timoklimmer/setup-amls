# How To Setup Azure Machine Learning Services

This repo contains a notebook which describes how you can
- setup an Azure Machine Learning Workspace (incl. some clusters, eg. Azure Kubernetes Service/AKS) and how you can
- configure your machine so you can use Azure Machine Learning Services from there.

Enjoy - and as always: feel free to use but don't blame me if things go wrong ;-)
